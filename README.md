Hey! Thanks for checking out my GitHub.

My name is Nick Mercuri. I’m 26 years old and based in Canada.

I graduated from UBC Okanagan in 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in Business Management. Since then, I've decided to pivot towards a career in software engineering and am currently working towards a bachelor's degree in Computer Science ([BCS](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/degree-programs/bcs-program-second-degree)) at UBC.

I enjoy problem-solving, working alongside collaborative teams, and using interesting technologies to find solutions to everyday challenges.

I’m currently seeking new graduate opportunities for Spring 2025. Previously, I've held SWE internships at Scotiabank (Python), TD Securities (Quarkus Java), TD Bank (Python) and Xneelo (Ruby on Rails).

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickmercuri/) or send me an email at nickdmercuri@gmail.com.
